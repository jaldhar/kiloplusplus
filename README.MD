# Kilo++

## A Text Editor

I did the [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) tutorial
which is in turn based on the original kilo editor by [antirez](http://antirez.com/news/108).  The steps of
the tutorial can be found in the `kilo-c-steps` branch of this repository or organized at a higher level in
the `kilo-c-features` branch.

The `master` branch contains my further changes.  I have converted the code to C++17
and split up the code into several files.
